# l6-build-data-model
Name Tag generator app using ES6 arrow functions, ReactDOM rendering App, key prop, and mapping

By adding the key prop id data to the data.js module you can return multiple name tags. You're welcome to fork and clone this repo if you would like to utilize or redo the exercise. There are comments through out so you can rewrite the coding yourself : )

This is using React library, arrow functions, key props/ids, importing and exporting accross multiple modules, and rendering mapped data

The l6-nametag-app-2 branch is a continuation where I deleted the data.js file b/c it was unneeded and converted the App component in the index.js file from a functional component to a stateful component.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to connect via email: mariemlaqua@gmail.com with "Coding" in the subject line : )
